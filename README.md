A minimal implementation of an operating system for robots, to ease the integration of sensors, actuators, and heavy compute directly in the physical world.

## üèõÔ∏è Design Philosophy

ü™∂ **Single-file solution**: `TinyROS` relies on [portal](https://github.com/danijar/portal) for reliable inter-process communication and works under the assumption that in most robotic systems, communication is primarily peer-to-peer or involves only a few subscribers per publisher (in [ROS](https://docs.ros.org/) terminology). This targeted approach allows us to strip down complexity significantly. We deliberately avoid the entire ROS ecosystem baggage while providing the familiar publisher-subscriber pattern for the 90% of use cases that don't need the full complexity of ROS2.

‚ú® **Cross-platform and easy to install**: `TinyROS` comes without installation headaches and is extremely lean while being cross-platform. You can develop on macOS, Windows, Linux, etc. It maintains the same (or better) efficiency as ROS2 implementations while being completely written in Python. We increase flexibility, ease of use, clarity, and reduce package size without compromising performance.

üéØ **Static configuration over dynamic discovery**: Unlike traditional ROS systems that rely on dynamic node discovery and runtime topic resolution, `TinyROS` deliberately enforces a static network configuration defined upfront. This design choice **is a feature, not a bug**. By requiring explicit declaration of all nodes, topics, and connections in a YAML configuration file, we achieve:

- *Clarity*: The entire system topology is visible at a glance
- *Predictability*: No surprises from nodes appearing or disappearing at runtime
- *Debugging*: Easy to trace data flow and identify connection issues
- *Documentation*: The network config serves as living documentation of your system
- *Reliability*: Eliminates race conditions and discovery-related failures

We believe that for most robotics applications, the network topology is known at design time and changes infrequently. Embracing this reality leads to simpler, more robust systems.
